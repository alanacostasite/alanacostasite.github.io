Ultimately, Acosta aims to show young POC that being themselves is one of the most important things that we as a society must learn to understand in order to transcend to a true oneness with ourselves and our loved ones, all while exploring his own voice and resonating his ideas with a spiritual and emotional force.</p><p>Additionally, Alan Acosta is first generation in this country and decidedly has made it one of his goals to bridge the gap between Black American music and Mexican American heritage with a focus on the effect of Black Intellectualism on modern America’s focus on musical art. Education through musical art being the medium that will play a large role in establishing a frontline methodology to tackle the prevalent issues of racism,classism, miseducation and ignorance in a country so rooted in the usage of POC culture to inform itself.</p></div></div><div class="Home_text__upzyl Home_overlay__yE804" style="width:0"><div class="Home_overlayContent__34_gl"><h2 class="Home_interactive__pT5DW"><a href="/">Home</a></h2><h2 class="Home_interactive__pT5DW"><a href="/live">Events</a></h2><h2 class="Home_interactive__pT5DW"><a href="/#connect">Connect</a></h2><h2 class="Home_interactive__pT5DW"><a href="/bio">Bio</a></h2><h2 class="Home_interactive__pT5DW"><a href="/media">Media</a></h2></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/bio","query":{},"buildId":"Atp3iG6pHhOCuOQVLjxII","assetPrefix":".","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
